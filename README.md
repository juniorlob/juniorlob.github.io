# Junior Lobo — @juniorlob

:wave: Hi! I'm a developer living in Santa Catarina, Brasil. I started my professional career in 2014.\
I'm deeply passionate about creating and shaping new concepts. My enthusiasm lies in exploring different viewpoints and bringing a unique glow to every idea. The true magic happens when I translate these concepts into programming language, crafting innovative products and applications. Software development is not just my profession, it's my fervor and the realm where my ideas come to life. :green_heart:
