          An advanced platform for Project Management, which utilizes Artificial Intelligence technology to act as an essential component in the software development cycle. As an integral part of the development team, I played a significant role in implementing the “Epics” feature, a characteristic comparable to established systems like Jira, but with a more streamlined scope.
          Next to the release date, we identified the need for a user interface overhaul. The task of updating the UI was assigned to the sub-team under my leadership, where I was able to implement significant improvements that enhanced the platform’s usability and aesthetics.

      Through Olby (formerly Jungle Devs), I worked for a company that oers a comprehensive software solution for gyms, covering billing, class scheduling, reporting, white-label apps, marketing automation, and lead management with a complete set of on-demand and live-streamed digital content. One of the solutions is the Embed Widget, a highly customizable product designed to integrate with any website.

      This product contains a digital content library widget that had an exponential performance issue with the amount of available content. I was able to assist the team by virtualizing all the content, making the application fast regardless of the number of videos listed. This was a complex issue the team was grappling with, and achieving such a performance improvement required extensive planning and discussion about the existing systems. This application was already live in production with a large user base, so everyone on the team had to stay well-aligned with a clear understanding of the consequences of any changes at all times to prevent production breakdowns. Communication with the team and the client was key to achieving this outcome.

      Retrospectives ([Monday marketplace](https://monday.com/marketplace/84) and [Visual Studio marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=appgami.appgami-retrospectives)) is a versatile application for agile teams to run real-time remote retrospective sessions.

      In this project, the challenges were numerous, the application is available in the Azure DevOps and Monday marketplaces, and the application flow and components must work for all services. The application renders the status of retrospectives and the entire state in real-time with remote participants present on the board. We also had the need to ensure backward compatibility and support at least two themes per marketplace.

      All these challenges brought complexity to this project. The team consisted of 2 frontend developers. With complex rules and a small team, I was very active in defining the technologies, libraries, and project architecture. Overall, it was a great opportunity to participate in the conception and entire process of setup and deployment in production.
